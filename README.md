## Project-Description

This project helps test one's knowledge on accurately "Manipulating the DOM" â€” A very important skill for Frontend Developers.
In this project, the navigation bar is dynamically built from Javascript and the interactions as well.
Clicking on each item on the navigation would scroll to the appropriate section of the page. And while scrolling through the page, the sections are highlighted as well as their corresponding navigation links.


## Usage
To scroll to the section you want, click the link on the navigation bar e.g, to scroll to Section 3, click Section 3 on the navigation bar.

To scroll to the top of the page, click the scroll to top button that shows up by the bottom-right side of the page.

To view the active state of each section, scroll to the section and you would see that the navigation link of that section is highlighted and the section itself is given some additional styles.


## Dependencies
For this project, I did not make use of any dependencies. The whole code was solely written by me.
